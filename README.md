# The DieForge d20 System
A classic pen-and-paper mechanic, implemented in Javascript. Roll for success!

## How to Use
The DieForge module is [UMD-wrapped](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) and supports Node, AMD, and the browser.

Briefly, use the DieForge to obtain a Die, then roll the Die, either for success or damage.
See the [API](https://github.com/seemikehack/dieforge/blob/master/API.md) for more information.
